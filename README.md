# macOS Matrix Screen Saver

![macOS Matrix Screen Saver demo](docs/matrix-screensaver.gif)

This is a macOS screen saver based on the iconic rain of characters and symbols known from the movie The Matrix.

## Quick install

1. Download the `.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/shinobi-resist/matrixScreenSaver/releases/latest) and open it.
2. Double-click the `.pkg` inside the mounted disk image to launch the installer.

   > **macOS Gatekeeper:** if macOS shows "Not Opened", right-click (Control-click) the `.pkg` and choose **Open**, then click **Open** in the confirmation. Or go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

3. Follow the installer wizard and enter your admin password when prompted. The screensaver installs to `/Library/Screen Savers/`.
4. System Settings opens automatically — select **MatrixScreenSaver** under Screen Saver.
5. Enjoy and donate<br>

## Options

The saver exposes a native **Options…** sheet. The values are stored with `ScreenSaverDefaults`.

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number scene | Show the startup number scene before continuous rain. | On |
| Twinkle | Turn on/off the twinkling effect. | On |
| Diffuse | Turn on/off the glow effect. | On |
| Character size | Set the character cell width and height in pixels.<br>Example pairs: 8 x 15, 9 x 17, 10 x 19, 11 x 21, 12 x 23, and 13 x 24. | 9 x 17 |
| Rain density | Set the factor for the density of rain drops. A positive number. | 1.0 |
| Frame rate | Set the frame rate per second. A positive number less than or equal to 1000. | 25 |
| Error rate | Set the factor for the rate of character changes. A non-negative number. | 1.0 |
| Characters | Restrict rain glyphs to a custom set (e.g. ATGC). Leave empty for the default. | *(empty)* |
| Neo message lines | Lines typed during the Neo message intro. Between 1 and 10 lines, up to 256 characters each. | The 4 classic lines |

## Development

### Current state

- Native Swift/AppKit screen saver bundle
- Edge-to-edge full-screen saver output, with terminal-style chrome kept in the preview host
- In-process renderer for `rain-forever` with an optional upstream `number` intro
- Native **Options…** sheet for Number scene, Twinkle, Diffuse, Character size, Rain density, Frame rate, Error rate, and Characters
- Preview app for fast iteration without reinstalling

### Repository layout

- `Sources/MatrixScreenSaver/MatrixScreenSaverView.swift` - screen saver view, layout, drawing, and option wiring
- `Sources/MatrixScreenSaver/NativeMatrixRenderer.swift` - native Matrix scene renderer
- `Sources/MatrixScreenSaver/MatrixScreenSaverOptions.swift` - options model and native configure sheet
- `Sources/MatrixScreenSaver/TerminalSupport.swift` - small shared terminal types used by the active renderer
- `Scripts/install-saver.sh` - shared ditto-based installer used by local installs
- `Tools/PreviewHost.swift` - local preview host used by `./preview.sh`
- `Resources/Info.plist` - bundle metadata

### Requirements

- macOS
- Xcode Command Line Tools with `swiftc`

Full Xcode is not required.

### Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

This creates the screen saver bundle:

```text
build/MatrixScreenSaver.saver
```

`build.sh` reads the current version from `./VERSION` and writes it into the saver bundle metadata.

### Preview without installing

```bash
./preview.sh
```

This rebuilds the bundle, compiles the preview host, and opens the saver in a normal macOS window for quick iteration.

### Install

```bash
./install.sh
```

`install.sh`:

1. rebuilds the saver bundle
2. strips quarantine from the source bundle and copies it to `~/Library/Screen Savers/MatrixScreenSaver.saver`
3. verifies the installed executable matches the build output
4. stops running `ScreenSaverEngine` / `legacyScreenSaver` processes so macOS reloads the updated bundle

After installing:

1. open **System Settings > Wallpaper > Screen saver...**
2. select **MatrixScreenSaver**

To relaunch the screen saver host manually:

```bash
open -a ScreenSaverEngine
```

### Origin

This project started as an attempt to wrap `cxxmatrix` inside a macOS screen saver.

The current implementation is based on the upstream [`akinomyoga/cxxmatrix`](https://github.com/akinomyoga/cxxmatrix) project and keeps its look and scene behavior, but it no longer launches an external terminal process at runtime. The active saver is a native in-process Swift/AppKit renderer because `ScreenSaverEngine` did not reliably render the external terminal stream.

The active renderer currently ports `rain-forever` and can optionally start with the upstream `number` intro.
